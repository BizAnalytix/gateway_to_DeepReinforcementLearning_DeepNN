Speech Recognition has seen a tremendous improvement in the last 5 years. People who have been accessing OK GOOGLE feature from the beginning would have lived the improvement in the last 5 years. Thanks to Deep Learning.

We use .wav file to read audio as mp3 cannot be read as .txt file. 
.wav is read using library librosa in python.

Sampling Rate- 

Mono Audio- 1 source of signal
we convert stereo audio to mono audio using Librosa library

Fourier Transform is a tool which allows us to convert our time domain signal into the frequency domain. A signal in the frequency domain requires much less computational space for storage.

Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs)
Our voice/sound is dependent on the shape of our vocal tract including tongue, teeth etc. If we can determine this shape accurately, we can recognize the word/character being said. MFCC is a representation of the short-term power spectrum of a sound, which in simple terms represents the shape of the vocal tract.
