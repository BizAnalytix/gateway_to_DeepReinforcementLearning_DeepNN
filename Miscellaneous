Autoencoder- encoding and decoding input file to get an output which is close to input one. So loss function is minimised. Main utility is to remove noise

Flattening in CNN- Itâ€™s actually very simple: the fully connected layer expects a vector as input. Convolution outputs a series of filters, which each are a grid shape. Flattening specifies a function mapping from these filters to a vector, so you can backpropagate errors back through the convolutional layers.

Verbose in Keras Model.fit
By setting verbose 0, 1 or 2 you just say how do you want to 'see' the training progress for each epoch.

verbose=0 will show you nothing (silent)

verbose=1 will show you an animated progress bar like this:

progres_bar

verbose=2 will just mention the number of epoch like this:
