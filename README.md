# Deep Learning application with latest architectures and models
Deep Learning application that use latest architectures and models along with dataset preparation tool [Supervise.ly](https://supervise.ly).

Deep Learning Applications 
---------
Please refer to following folders to go through the 
          **interatcive IPYNB** files for the following **AI Models** , along with related **dockers & docker run time commands** for the models, and also detailed refernce blogs from MEDIUM.

Prerequisites for DL Applications
-------------
- **Docker - Highly recommended** 

   *[Dockerfile, docker build, nvidia-docker run for anpr](anpr/docker)

   *[Dockerfile, docker build, nvidia-docker run for anpr_ocr](anpr_ocr/docker)

   *[Dockerfile, docker build, nvidia-docker run for ssd](ssd/docker)

   *[Dockerfile, docker build, nvidia-docker run for unet_training](unet_training/docker)

- **CUDA-capable GPU is required for training**
- **An account on [Supervise.ly](https://supervise.ly) for data annotation**
