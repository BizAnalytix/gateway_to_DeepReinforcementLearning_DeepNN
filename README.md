# 80-days-study-guide-to-Deep-Learning-Reinforced-Learning-and-Deep-Reinforced-Learning
In this repository I will pen down my strategy for career transition to DL,RL,DRL. Since the most difficult thing in self preparation is to time schedule, so I will share mine one.

My schedule of study (in terms of days) 
1. 23 Oct- 30 Oct ( 1 week)- Purpose was to get a theoretical basics of Deep Learning, Reinforced Learning and Deep Reinforced Learning
