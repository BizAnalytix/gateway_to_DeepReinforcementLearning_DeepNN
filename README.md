Deep Learning Applications 
---------
<a name="deepNN-apps"></a>

Please refer to following folders to go through the 
          **interatcive IPYNB** files for the following Deep Learning **Computer Vision AI Models** , along with related **dockers & docker run time commands** for the models, and also detailed refernce blogs from MEDIUM.
          
- **[Automated Number Plate Detection- Computer Vision model](anpr)** - Number plate detection with Supervisely and Tensorflow [(medium)](https://medium.com/p/e84c74d4382c)

- **[Image Segmentation- Computer Vision model](unet_training)** - Training road scene segmentation on Cityscapes with Tensorflow andÂ UNet [(medium)](https://medium.com/p/1232314781a8)

Prerequisites for DL Applications
-------------
- **Docker - Highly recommended** 

   *[Dockerfile, docker build, nvidia-docker run for anpr](anpr/docker)

   *[Dockerfile, docker build, nvidia-docker run for anpr_ocr](anpr_ocr/docker)

   *[Dockerfile, docker build, nvidia-docker run for ssd](ssd/docker)

   *[Dockerfile, docker build, nvidia-docker run for unet_training](unet_training/docker)

- **CUDA-capable GPU is required for training**
- An account on [Supervise.ly](https://supervise.ly) for data annotation
- **Microservice for AI Model binary deployment as AI-as-a-Service**
    [flask_apps for creating AI-as-a-Service](flask_apps)  Using Flask Micro web framework to create Predict RESTful API service (AI-as-a-Service)
