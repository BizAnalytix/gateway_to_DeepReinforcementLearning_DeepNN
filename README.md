# Technical Nuances of World of Deep-Learning | Deep-Reinforcement-Learning | 


This repository is my humble endeavour to take a you through **The Best of AI** by introducing you to very many constructs, design elements, real applications, codesets, FAQs from the beautiful landscape of AI.  Bon Vaoyage!

A commitment:   *I, The Sailor of the Cruise- DeepHiveMind, would continue to enrich this repository in my relentless persuit of democratizing the field of AI.*

Welcome Onboard! 

Your journey begins with **The wonderland of AI** wherein you get to relish the gigantic-yet-so-beautiful landscape of AI. Herein, you will be pampered with Infographic panoramic view of the design, and the sweeping constructs of AI. I'm sure, You'll relish the AI wonderland! 

Post that, In this voyage, you will be treated with ultra-luxurious warmth of **The REAL world of AI applications**, wherein pleathora of ***actual codesets*** from varied flavour will welcome you in detail. Please cherish the tangy-yet-so-sweet flavour of AI application codesets! Please refer to the delicately hand crafted [exquisite bouquet of offerings](#The-vantage-view-of-Agenda). Hold on for a sec!!

Every destination of this tour is delicately curated to make your AI experience wonderful. This carefully-curated AI itinerary is planned by me based on my 10+ dedicated years of *rich, deep hands-on engagement* with various streams of **"Enterprise AI, ML, NLP-Generation, Knowlede Graph, Converstaional AI, DL(Deep Learning) & DRL(Deep Reinforcement Learning)"** - be it   	
		
		- **classical Predictive machine learning**,
		
		- **Cognitive AI** , powered by Deep Neural networks, such as 
			- Computer vision, 
			- Natural Language Proessing, Understanding,  Generataion (NLP-NLU-NLG), 				
			- Audio & Speech analytics, 
			- Conversational AI,
			- Multimodal analytics
		
		- **Knowledge Graph**,

					- Apache JENA/ AWS NEPTUNE with SPARQL
					- GRAKN with GRAQL
			
			- Semantic lexicon for 
				- BioMedical ontology (used for Precision Medicine & Disease Network - BioGrakn)
				- English language (used extensively by computational linguists and cognitive scientists - WordNet/ SynSet
				- Law (legal ontologies for Law based knowledge formalization - JurWordNet/ DOLCE+)
		
		
		- **AutoML**,
			- AutoKeras (NAS with Bayesian Optimization)
			- Google AutoML (NAS with Reinforcement Leaning)
			- Hyper Parameter Optimization
			- Randmoized/Grid Serach optimization
		
		- **Distributed & Parallel ML**,  
		
		- **AI-as-a-Service**,
			- RESTful API
			- gRPC API
			
		- **Deep reinforcement-learning** (self learning autonomous systems), 
		
		- **Custom MLOps** (the Next-Gen MLOPS),
		
		- **Comprehensive AI GOVERNANCE**,
			- 'AI TRUST' 
   			- 'AI Collaboration, Sharing & Exchange' 
             		- 'AI Security' 
			- 'AI Scalability' 
  			- 'AI Inference Model Update/ Roll out' Mechanism 
			
		- **SERVERLESS AI/ML**
		
		and so on so forth for variuos industries such as  ***Banking & FS, Insurance, Halthcare, Retail, Energy and utility.***
