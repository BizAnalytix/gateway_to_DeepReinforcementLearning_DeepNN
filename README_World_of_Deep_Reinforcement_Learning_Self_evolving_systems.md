# World of Deep Reinforcement Learning Self evolving systems

<p> Welcome to <b> The World of Deep Reinforcement Learning- Powering Self Evolving System</b>. It's a reference to series of blog posts and videos ðŸ†• about Deep Reinforcement Learning. It primarily includes

- Introduction to the <b>main DeepRL algorithms</b> , and 
- how to implement them with <b> Tensorflow</b> .



#### Industry Implementation of Deep RL

Deep RL is one of the key factor powering -
-  Self Evolving System
-  Hyperautomation
-  Google AutoML (NAS + Deep RL)
-  TRAX ([AI with Speed in Sequence Model](https://github.com/google/trax) )
-  Autocorrection, autocompletion in Email/Typing/NLP (heady mix of dynamic programming, hidden Markov models, and word embeddings) 
-  Autonomous Systems
-  Smart Deep Gaming
-  Many more
