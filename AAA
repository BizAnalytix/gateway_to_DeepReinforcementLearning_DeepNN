  Install imagemagick, pdftotext (found in a package named poppler-utils within some package managers) and ocrmypdf. The latter is a fast (ocr takes a lot of cpu, and it is configured to use all your cores), open-source and frequently updated piece of OCR software. This approach is possibly overkill as it actually tries to assign a string to each word instead of just labeling a word, but I've had a lot of trouble finding good and easy to use opensource OCR software in general. Then, in the directory where you have saved all your JPGs:
  $ convert *.jpg pictures.pdf
  $ ocrmypdf pictures.pdf scanned.pdf
  $ pdftotext scanned.pdf scanned.txt
  $ wc -w scanned.txt
