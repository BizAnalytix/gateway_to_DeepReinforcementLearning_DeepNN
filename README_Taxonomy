The 1st Generation AI:
The first generation of AI was rules-based and emulated classical logic to draw reasoned conclusions within a specific, narrowly defined problem domain. It was well suited to monitoring processes and improving efficiency, for example. 

The 2nd Generation AI:
The second, current generation is largely concerned with sensing and perception, such as using deep-learning networks to analyze the contents of a video frame.

The 3dr Generation AI:
A coming next generation will extend AI into areas that correspond to human cognition, such as interpretation and autonomous adaptation. Next-generation AI must be able to address novel situations and abstraction to automate ordinary human activities.
		- Q) What Is New in 3rd Gen AI?
		- A) This will overcome the so-called “brittleness” of AI solutions based on neural network training and inference.  
		
		- Q) What do you mean by the so-called “brittleness” of AI solutions?
		- A) Deep neural network training and inference heavily depend on literal, deterministic views of events that lack context and commonsense understanding.
