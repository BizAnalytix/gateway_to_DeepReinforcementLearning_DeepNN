Motto of Github- People who lives in solace thinks while the world works in united group

Git was created by Linus.

Oh Yes that is the name of the guy who created Linus.

Aim of Git was to create a distributed system where people can work individually and then push the changes to the common project. In this way multiple people can work on same project. But some people might suggest different changes to same code which might be in conflict. Hurray MERGE CONFLICT sorts that out.

It is just like how individual people enjoy liberty and work on their own which help in fulfilling government agendas. Sometimes conflict arises when liberty boundary on one compromised the other then judiciary like merge conflict sorts that out
