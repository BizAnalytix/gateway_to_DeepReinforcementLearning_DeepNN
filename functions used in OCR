from skimage(Utilities to read and write images in various formats.) import io - io.imread(fname)[:,:] / 255.

The assert Statement
When it encounters an assert statement, Python evaluates the accompanying expression, which is hopefully true. 
If the expression is false, Python raises an AssertionError exception.

The syntax for assert is −

assert Expression[, Arguments]

tf.random.truncated_normal(
    shape,
    mean=0.0,
    stddev=1.0,
    dtype=tf.float32,
    seed=None,
    name=None
)
Defined in tensorflow/python/ops/random_ops.py.

Outputs random values from a truncated normal distribution.

The only difference with a regular Session is that an InteractiveSession installs itself as the default session on construction. 

tf.train.Saver - Saves and restores variables.

collections.Counter() 
A counter is a container that stores elements as dictionary keys, and their counts are stored as dictionary values.
